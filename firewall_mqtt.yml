  mqttNode: openwrt #name for your node... can use anything

#for each of the devices in "names" you need to tell the script the rule number to modify
#first create in openwrt the rules that you want to activate/deactivate. You can use LUCI or the command interface. 
#once you have created the rules, then use "uci show firewall" to display the rules. Determine which rules correspond to the device you are trying to control

#for example, to block the firetablet I have rule #3
#firewall.@rule[3]=rule
#firewall.@rule[3].name='firekill'
#firewall.@rule[3].target='REJECT'
#firewall.@rule[3].src_mac='XXXXXXXX'
#firewall.@rule[3].dest='wan'
#firewall.@rule[3].src='lan'
#firewall.@rule[3].enabled='0'

#note that enabled=1 means that the rule is active, or that the internet is "off" for that device. 

roku:
  rule: 1

ipad:
  rule: 2

firetablet:
  rule: 3
